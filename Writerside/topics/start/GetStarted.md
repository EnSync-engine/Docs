    Self-host EnSync
</title>
<p>
EnSync provides public images on Docker hub which can used on almost any container engine (OCI complaint).
</p>
<br/>
To start EnSync you would need to download the compose.yml file
<deflist>
    <def title="Download EnSync Service">
        Download <resource src="./compose.yml"/> and open it.
    </def>
<def title="Start EnSync Service and set Environment variables">
        Download <resource src="./engine.sh"/> and open it.
    </def>
</deflist>

First let's talk about the content of the file
<deflist>
    <def title="Master Node">
        <p>The master-node which we occasionally call "EnSync node" in our documentation</p>
        <p></p>
    </def>
